		<p class="imgcaption">A short animated film about plague doctors. The doctors of this period in the 1340s, during the outbreak of the Bubonic plague, were guided on the theory of "The Humors" before the advent of germ theory. Part of the theory of Humors, traced the causes of sickness and death to foul odors. Plague doctors can be seen wearing their signature beaked masks, which were often filled with sweet scented aromas like lavender, preventing the scent of "miasma" coming from the patients from reaching the doctor. Plague doctors were, not always, but often unexperienced physicians who often accelerated their patient's deaths by providing experimental "treatments". Using medieval devices such as, blood letting which often lead to infection, flaggelation, whipping of one's self or someone else to "purify" them. Often as history repeats itself, it should be noted that people with good intentions can lead down a destructive path. Sometimes even for those who they care about the most.</p>
